Design and develop a simple Notes Android app, which has the following features:
• Use only 1 activity for the entire app. Use fragments for different screens.
• When a user starts the app, a login screen appears (if the user is not logged in). Login can 
only happen through Google+. Use shared preferences/ SQLite to track logged in users.
• Once the user logs in, display all notes of the logged in user (complete notes, not preview). 
Use Recyclerview to display notes.
• Add a button to add a new note.
• Allow users to update a note.
• Allow the user to delete a note.
